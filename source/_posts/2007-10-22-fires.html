I returned to SoCal today to find it hot and burning. Quite a change from the 1-2 inches of snow on the ground in Denver. We flew over one of the fires where more than 100 homes have burned. The smoke from another fire (near Santa Clarita, I think) fills the whole Ventura/Oxnard area. In daylight, there is a strange orange glow and this evening the sun disappeared about 40 minutes early. It just sort of faded into red and then was gone. The smoke comes in to all of the buildings at work and my apartment, making my eyes itch.

I didn't get any pictures today, but maybe tomorrow.
