I have been living in Portland OR for the summer. <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a> has hired me to work on the <a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org">Portland Project</a>, a cross desktop framework for Linux.

<strike>I have posted some <a href="/gallery/pics/2006_summer_portland/">photos</a> of various activities.</strike> <em>(UPDATE: Gallery is broken at the moment and I don't have time to deal with it.)</em>
