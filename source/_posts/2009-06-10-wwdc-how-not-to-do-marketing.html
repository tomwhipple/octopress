Ok, if you are going to hand out cards inviting all the conference attendees to a "party" (i.e. captive demo) and promise free drinks &amp; appetizers, it is a good idea to make sure you have enough free drinks and appetizers to go around. After all, if you can't organize a party, how can I possibly believe that you can build a functional product.

I'm talking to you Parallez &amp; Appcellerator (or however you spell it).

We'll see if tonight is any better ...
