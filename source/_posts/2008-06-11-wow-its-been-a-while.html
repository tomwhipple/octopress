But, I'm still alive.

After my own server died a few months ago, I finally have my website moved over to laughingsquid.net. As far as I can tell everything is now back up and running.
<p align="center"> <a href="http://www.laughingsquid.com"><img src="http://www.laughingsquid.net/images/powered_white.gif" alt="Powered by Laughing Squid" width="150" height="50" border="0" /></a></p>
Most of the outage has been due to my own laziness. I haven't been motivated to keep the site up lately. But, Laughing Squid seems to have very responsive servers, which is far more than I can say about godaddy.com.
