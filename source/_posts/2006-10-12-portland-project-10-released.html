This week the <a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org">Portland Project</a> released version 1.0. (I spent the summer in Portland working on this.)<em> <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/">Linux User & Developer</a></em> magazine is publishing an article (<a href="http://www.osdl.org/Documents/LuD68_Cherry_Portland.pdf">pdf</a>) in <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=172">this month's issue</a> about the Portland effort. This summer we also noticed that Google picked up a pre-release version for their beta release of <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> for Linux.
