I wrote some Perl modules a while back and have always meant to release them to the general community. I haven't had time to do all that is required to get them up to <a href="http://search.cpan.org">CPAN</a> yet (namely write tests), but here is the first step. See the "<a href="/software/">Software by Tom</a>" page.

I expect to release one or two more additional projects soon.
