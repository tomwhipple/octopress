Yes, that's a bold claim. But I stand by it. I'll skip straight to the important part:

[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org) makes it dead simple to explore your code/data. Just look at my [simple signal processing example](/projects/explorations/basic-signal-processing-with-ipython-notebook.html). 

Intrigued? If you've already installed IPython (and numpy/scipy and matplotlib), you've already got it! Just start notebook:

```$ ipython notebook --pylab inline```

The notebook console will open in a browser window. (Ok, you might need a couple more dependencies, but how hard is that??)

Then all you have to do is [download the notebook](/projects/explorations/basic-signal-processing-example.ipynb) and **drag it to the console browser window!** How awesome is that?!

And, if that isn't enough, a lot of work has been put into it's multi-processing abilities. It is well worth the time to [watch the introductory video](http://ipython.org/videos.html).
