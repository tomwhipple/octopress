So far, the new iPhone software released on Friday doesn't look good. I've had two problems in as many days.

Yesterday, the bluetooth headset did not deactivate after a call ended until after I unlocked the phone with the slider dodad.

But the worst happened today. I was driving down the PCH enjoying the day and a listening to a podcast when my phone decided to stop playing the podcast and dial a friend. At first I thought he was calling me, but after an akward confused silance I realized what had happened. Needless to say, this is very bizzare and totally unacceptable. Imagine being in the middle of a personal conversation when your phone decides to call a random contact!!

So, 2.0.1 is still looking pretty good.
