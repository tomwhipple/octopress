The site is mostly done with its overhaul. The layout is XHTML/CSS rather than a table mess. I've finally got <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress </a>customized to my satisfaction. Of course now that the semester has started, I doubt that I'll have much time to post here, but the background work is done.

I still intend to post some info about projects I am currently working on, as well as those I've finished with.
