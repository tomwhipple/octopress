Ok, here are some dos &amp; don'ts for all you recruiters out there:
<ul>
	<li><strong>DON'T cold call me just because I've just connected with someone you know on LinkedIn.</strong></li>
	<li>DON'T pretend that I should know who you are. - If you've never spoken to me before, an introduction is appropriate.</li>
	<li>DON'T just use random keywords from my blog and profile and assume they define me. Just because I've written about an SEO talk I went to two years ago doesn't mean that I do SEO a living. (Hint: My resume &amp; profile talk about software development. SEO is <em>not</em> software development).</li>
	<li>DON'T just pass on my name and number to a co-worker without any context.</li>
	<li>DO <em>email</em> me with an introduction and specific details and, if you must call, ask for a good  time to do so.</li>
	<li>DO know who I am and what I do <em>before</em> you call.</li>
	<li>DO understand that my time is valuable and that, as a contractor,Â  I'm losing money if I'm talking to you.</li>
</ul>
(And in case you are thinking about contacting me, I'm not looking for new opportunities at the moment.)
